General tools for econ-ark. Directories:

## Web

Tools for creation of web resources, like css style files etc

## Machine

Different ways to construct a self-contained Econ-ARK machine:

### Virtual

Create a Virtual Machine that you can run on a host computer. Because your computer's resources will be shared with the VM, both your regular processes (email, etc) and the Econ-ARK machine's processes may be slow.

### Metal

Take an existing computer and set it up so it can boot the Econ-ARK system on an external drive or flash stick. 
   * Your machine will be faster and more efficient than the Virtual option. 

### Hybrid/Cloud

Convert an existing platform running Debian/Ubuntu into the Econ-ARK machine.
